# MOQA

MOQA is a framework for multiobjective optimization of peptide properties using QUBO samplers. It consists from the binary autencoder that is used for the binary descrete latent space construction. It provides binary encoding of peptide sequences. For extraction of peptide sequences with desired properies from it FMQA based approach is used. We extended it to simultaneous optimization of multiple properies of interest.

# Usage

* In order make a demo run execute

```
python sampler.py
```
